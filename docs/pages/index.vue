[![feedz.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/endpoint.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Ff.feedz.io%2Fdavidfowl%2Ffeatherhttp%2Fshield%2FFeatherHttp%2Flatest&label=FeatherHttp)](https://f.feedz.io/davidfowl/featherhttp/packages/FeatherHttp/latest/download)

A lightweight low ceremony APIs for ASP.NET Core applications.

- Built on the same primitives as ASP.NET Core
- Optimized for building HTTP APIs quickly
- Take advantage of existing ASP.NET Core middleware and frameworks

The strength of FeatherHttp is that, unlike ASP.NET Core MVC or API, web application services are individually configured and therefore FeatherHttp apps require much less ceremony. This means that you only add the services that you plan to use. Further, you can reasonably create an entire functional dotnet web application in a single .cs file.
